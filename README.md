# AlphaQ
Creating a 5x5 GO agent that utilizes principles for DeepMind's AlphaZero
In build.sh, select which agent you want to play against by changing TA(set to manual if you want to play against agent)


Works using Monte Carlo tree search. Neural Network training put on hold as grad school takes a lot more time that expected.
